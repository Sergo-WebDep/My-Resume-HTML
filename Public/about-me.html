    <h2>What defines me</h2>
        <p>Although my main training is aimed at the world of cinema and theater, I have always taken care to expand my skills and knowledge to be able to face the complexities of real life, aware that Art enriches me spiritually, but it does not always feed me. .
        Either alternately, or even in parallel with my work as a screenwriter, I have also worked in manual jobs as a waiter and supermarket stocker.
        I know how to work with power and hand tools, I speak English and Czech, I have computer skills (at the advanced user level) and I can even program (static) web pages. I like programming and as a teenager I knew how to program in “Basic” language on my old Commodore PC-I.
        I am dynamic, communicative, and optimistic. I am also punctual, responsible and I do not see work as an ordeal, but as a means to progress in life. And whether I work with my hands or with my intellect, I'm not afraid to learn new things. For this I have a skill: I am an observer. I like to work as a team and contribute to a common idea or project. But, I also know how to work alone if I am given the necessary guidelines and guidance.
        I believe that in life not only your skills and knowledge are valuable, but also the desire to work.</p>
